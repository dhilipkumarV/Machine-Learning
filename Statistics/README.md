# Statistics guide

**Introduction**
- **What are Statistics?** - Statistics include numerical facts and figures
- **Decriptive Statisitcs** - Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data. Descriptive statistics are just descriptive. They do not involve generalizing beyond the data at hand
- **Inferential statistics** - The mathematical procedures whereby we convert information about the sample into intelligent guesses about the population fall under the rubric of inferential statistics
  - **Simple random sampling** - Every member of the population to have an equal chance of being selected into the sample
  - **More complex sampling** - Random division of a specifically selected population in 2 or more grounds is called *random assignment.* Random assignment is critical for validity of an experiment.Randomly sampling from each of the stratas/subgroups in such a way that the sizes of the subgroups in the sample are proportional to their sizes in the population is called *stratified sampling*
- **Percentiles** - X percentile of a series of numbers is the weighted average of the numbers forming the floor and ceiling values of the rank calculated using X --> R = X*(N+1)/100
- **Levels of measurement**
  - Types of scales -
    - **Nominal scales** - When measuring using a nominal scale, one simply names or categorizes responses. Nominal scales do not imply any ordering among the responses
    - **Ordinal scales** - Scales with some level of ordering in them are termed ordinal scales. The values on ordinal scale need not be equally spaced
    - **Interval scales** - Interval scales are numerical scales in which intervals have the same interpretation throughout. Interval scales need not have a true zero due to which we cannot take thier ratio
    - **Ratio scales** - Ratio scale is an interval scale with the additional property that its zero position indicates the absence of the quantity being measured
