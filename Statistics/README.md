# Statistics guide

**Introduction**
- **What are Statistics?** - Statistics include numerical facts and figures
- **Decriptive Statisitcs** - Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data. Descriptive statistics are just descriptive. They do not involve generalizing beyond the data at hand
- **Inferential statistics** - The mathematical procedures whereby we convert information about the sample into intelligent guesses about the population fall under the rubric of inferential statistics
  - **Simple random sampling** - Every member of the population to have an equal chance of being selected into the sample
  - **More complex sampling** - Random division of a specifically selected population in 2 or more grounds is called *random assignment.* Random assignment is critical for validity of an experiment.Randomly sampling from each of the stratas/subgroups in such a way that the sizes of the subgroups in the sample are proportional to their sizes in the population is called *stratified sampling*
