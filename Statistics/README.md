## 1. Introduction
- **What are Statistics?** - Statistics include numerical facts and figures
- **Decriptive Statisitcs** - Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to summarize and describe data. Descriptive statistics are just descriptive. They do not involve generalizing beyond the data at hand
- **Inferential statistics** - The mathematical procedures whereby we convert information about the sample into intelligent guesses about the population fall under the rubric of inferential statistics
  - **Simple random sampling** - Every member of the population to have an equal chance of being selected into the sample
  - **More complex sampling** - Random division of a specifically selected population in 2 or more grounds is called *random assignment.* Random assignment is critical for validity of an experiment.Randomly sampling from each of the stratas/subgroups in such a way that the sizes of the subgroups in the sample are proportional to their sizes in the population is called *stratified sampling*
- **Percentiles** - X percentile of a series of numbers is the weighted average of the numbers forming the floor and ceiling values of the rank calculated using X --> R = X*(N+1)/100
- **Levels of measurement** - 
  - Types of scales -
    - **Nominal scales** - When measuring using a nominal scale, one simply names or categorizes responses. Nominal scales do not imply any ordering among the responses
    - **Ordinal scales** - Scales with some level of ordering in them are termed ordinal scales. The values on ordinal scale need not be equally spaced
    - **Interval scales** - Interval scales are numerical scales in which intervals have the same interpretation throughout. Interval scales need not have a true zero due to which we cannot take thier ratio
    - **Ratio scales** - Ratio scale is an interval scale with the additional property that its zero position indicates the absence of the quantity being measured
- **Distributions** - 
  - Frequency distribution is a plot of the number of occurences of each level of a variable in a given sample of data
  - For continuous variables we use grouped frequency distribution
  - **Probability densities** - To represent the probability associated with an arbitrary movement (which can take any positive amount of time), we must represent all these potential times at once. Distributions for continuous variables are called grouped frequecy dist. or probabilty density
  - **Shapes of distributions** - Positive skew/Right tailed, Negative skew, Bimodal(distribution with 2 peaks), leptokurtic & platykurtic (higher/fewer scores in the tails)
- **Linear transformations** - Multiplying and adding a constant
- **Logarithms** - Log transformations reduce positive skew
