  - A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item
  - Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways â€“ through collaborative filtering or through content-based filtering (also known as the personality-based approach)
    - **Collaborative filtering** approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in
    - **Content-based filtering** approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. These approaches are often combined as Hybrid recommendation systems
