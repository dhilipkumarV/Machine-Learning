## Introduction to NLP
  - NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from  text data
  - Terms and their meanings
    - Tokenization – process of converting a text into tokens
    - Tokens – words or entities present in the text
    - Text object – a sentence or a phrase or a word or an article

## Text Preprocessing
- 3 major steps of cleaning and standardization of text, making it noise-free -

- **Noise removal**
  - Text that is not in context of the data and end output can be termed as noise
  - Examples are language stopwords, URLs, industry specific words, social media specific hashtags  
- **Lexicon Normalization**
  - Lexicon normalization attemots to use the vocabulary dictionary to tranform words into thier root word form
  - Stemming - Deals with removal of suffixes from the words
  - Lemmatization - Considers the grammar and morphology of the word before making transformations
- **Object standardization**
  - Deals with removing texts, phrases that are not present in standard vocabulary dictionaries. Eg. - Internet slangs, hashtags, etc.
