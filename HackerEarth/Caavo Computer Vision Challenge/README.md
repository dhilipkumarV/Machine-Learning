#### Keras : Overview

The key features of Keras are:
- **Modularity** : Modules necessary for building a neural network are included in a simple interface so that Keras is easier to use for the end user
- **Minimalistic** : Implementation is short and concise
- **Extensibility** : Itâ€™s very easy to write a new module for Keras and makes it suitable for advance research

#### General way to solve problems with Neural Networks

- Check if it is a problem where Neural Network gives you uplift over traditional algorithms (refer to the checklist in the section above)
- Do a survey of which Neural Network architecture is most suitable for the required problem
- Define Neural Network architecture through whichever language / library you choose.
- Convert data to right format and divide it in batches
- Pre-process the data according to your needs
- Augment Data to increase size and make better trained models
- Feed batches to Neural Network
- Train and monitor changes in training and validation data sets
- Test your model, and save it for future use
