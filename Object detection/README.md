<h2>Object detection and tracking</h2>


<h3>Using mobile phone as an IP camera</h3>

* Go to your app store and install IP Webcam
* Open the app, Press “Start server” and note the IP address mentioned at the bottom of the screen
* Connect both your phone and your laptop to the same network, maybe using a mobile 
* Follow this [link](https://www.hackster.io/peter-lunk/how-to-use-the-android-ip-webcam-app-with-python-opencv-45f28f) to create your python code



<h3>Workflow for human and baggage detection</h3>

**Human**
* **Video Capture** - OpenCV
* **Detection** - Reinspect
* **Tracking** - HOG, HAAR, MHT

**Baggage**
* **Detection** - Reinspect, YOLO(Single-/ Multi - class)

<h3>Action items</h3> 
* Research up on
  * [**RNNs**](https://wiki.tum.de/display/lfdv/Recurrent+Neural+Networks+-+Combination+of+RNN+and+CNN)
  * [RCNNs](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-rcnns-with-this-toy-dataset-be19dce380ec)
  * RNN vs CNN vs RCNN
  * [**Darknet**](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/)
  * [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron)

* Setup YOLO by researching on the codes
* Read up on OpenCV documentation
* Introduction to computer vision courese Udacity
