<h3>Lesson 1 : 1A-L1</h3>

* Computer vision and Computer Photography
    * Computer photography - Capturing light from a scene to record a photograph
    * Image analysis - Supports the capture in novel ways
    * Computer vision - Interpreting and analysis of the scene
    
* Introduction to computer vision

* What is computer vision?
    * Image goes in and somthing meaningful or interpretable comes out
    * Understanding what is in the image
    
 * How can we make a computer recognize actions like movement, flapping like a bird, etc.
 
 * Object recognition - 
    * Evolution robotics - LaneHawk

<h3>Lesson 2 : 2A-L1</h3>

* Images as functions - intro
* Images as functions - Part 1
   * I(x, y)
      * x, y = co-ordinates of a grayscaled image
      * I = intensity
   * Image processing side of computer vision is taking images and creating new functions or getting some information out
      * Smoothening the function/ blurring the image

* Images as functions - Part 2
   * We can think of images as functions that map R2 to R:
      * f(x,y) gives intensity or value at position (x, y)
   * For color images f:R2-->R3
   
* Digital images
   * In computer vision we work on digital(discrete) images
