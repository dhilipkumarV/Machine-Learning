# Setting up pyyolo to train and test on customer data

# Steps involved and clarification required
* Understand the pyyolo module and what arguments are taken by it
  * Where is the pyyolo module located?
  * How is the pyyolo module calling YOLO model? How is initialization done?
* Prepare the input data for yolo
  * What should the structure for YOLO input file need to be?
  * What is the format of input data required by YOLO
  * What should go into the parser that converts input images into a format that YOLO can use?
* Training in python
  * Can I change the version of YOLO that needs to be trained using pyyolo library
